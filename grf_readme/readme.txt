Timberwolf's Bridge Tweaks
==========================

A small set of tweaks to the default game bridges, to
provide better aesthetic variety and more gameplay options.
This aligns bridges closer to their real-world introduction
dates, rebalances speeds to improve early game options and
avoid the "single best bridge" effect, and makes faster
bridges significantly more expensive.

There is the option to replace the yellow tubular steel
bridge with a new "Girder, Iron" to provide more options
during the early part of the game. This may interact badly
when using the default road and track sets as it recolours
the entire sprite.
